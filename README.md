# Artifact - Microfiche/Mother Earth Journal

105 x 148 mm card made out transparent film. The content has been reduced 24% 25 % in size. It can be read be reader by a special microfiche/film reader. This microfishe serie contain the journal Mother Earth. This journal pay attention to science and literature. Founded by the anarchist Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. The journal ran from March 1906 t August 1918. Came in various volume and monthly issues.

# Research

My research started with examining the potential and spectrum of IISH archives. Where examined in various subjects and objects. Here I came across Emma Goldman's and her story where I began and request some physical materials where I find these microfiches, which are not visualized on the website. So when they came, I received these microfiches with no idea what it was and how I could use it. I got an introduction to the machine that can help to see the pages on a large scale. The whole technical thing in it caught my interest but also this magazine and the magazine's vision and mission.

Derrida in Archive Fever desricbe the similiarity between an srchive and the human psylogi mnd. How we capture, select, lost memory. That our urgent to control everything, but as Derrida desribe that there will always be another perspective. 
He desricbe as well that in a arhive will never be a linear narrative. its about perspective and personally  opinion/direction. Can I use the way/function(machine) of used of the microfilm today?. To transcode this magazine in the future. installation. circle experiences. Where to break the circle?

## Microfiche

<summary><b>What is a microfiche?</b></summary>
 A microfiche is a sheet of flat film, 105 x 148 mm. Microfiche is a type of film. Each piece of film can hold more than one hundred pages of printed text. The film varies in size but is usually just a few inches long and wide. A microfiche reader is necessary to then read the film. Microfiche allows various institutions to save space by converting paper documents, which take up much more space, to smaller microfiche files. Historically, libraries found microfiche very useful to expand their collections, while saving space. With advances in computers, many libraries and businesses have replaced their microfiche files with computerized ones. A microfiche can be in negative and positive films Microfiche aims to store fragile documents in an analog format, which may be newspapers, paper documents, or other paper material that has storage needs.

<summary><b>The history of microfiche and its use</b></summary>
The history of microfilm starts around the same time as the invention of photography. John Benjamin Dancer was one of the first to produce microphotographs in 1839, where he achieved a reduction ratio of 160:1. Throughout his life dancer perfected his microfilm results, and by 1853 he was successfully selling microphotographs as slides which could be viewed with a microscope. Throughout the rest of the century the science of microfilm continued to develop, as more people began to see new applications for the practice. One of its first real uses came during the Franco-Prussian war, where they were used to send messages to and from the front lines using pigeon carriers who could only carry large documents using microfilm.

In the 1930’s the process was developed onto 35mm film, and saw its first real application for document storage when the University Microfilms Inc (UMI) was created by Eugene Power. He had previously been microfilming rare books, but now began making records of important dissertations. During WW2 the process was mainly used for espionage, as they could be used by spies to move around or send documents without them being found. They were also used for regular military mail purposes, and also by governments who feared their records and archives could be destroyed through relentless bombing campaigns.

In the post war years the technology for microfilm continued to improve, with better film, viewers and readers being produced. The possibility of using microfilm as an information source as well as storage was explored. This lead to libraries developing their capabilities in this area, and by the 1970’s the practice had become much more affordable and was used for a huge variety of applications.

As the introduction of computers and the internet arrived in the 1990’s, this improved technology also increased output for microform applications. This meant they could now be produced directly from a computer, and then used for an unlimited amount of uses such as hospital records or catalogues.

As the reliability of Microforms will never change, they are used by all kinds of libraries and archives as the best way to keep a hard copy of every document, and ensure they are never lost. Although they cannot be moved or shared in the same way as a digital file, they are completely full proof and will stand easily stand the test of time.

<summary><b>My uses of the microfiche</b></summary>
* **WHAT:** I wanted to figure out the machines functionality. So I recorded my self useing it with different focus points. Recording of my handgesture when I was useing the machine. The screen function of zoom in and out. The sound of the machine.

* **TOOL:** Video camera, handhold recording

* **OUTCOME:** Video recording

# Transcoding

### Description

In my transcoding I wanted to research how to preserved these microfiches and the journal with a more accessible contemporary mediums. How can I preserve this microfiche with this text based journal into a more understanding narrative with a mission and vision, without losing its context. One of the big lack of a microfiche is the cost expenses. Reading microfiches need a reader-printers are not always available, often on a public library, limiting the potential user and the ability to make copies. I want to show that the issues from a 100 years old journal is still nowadays headlines issues in different format og outcomes. But the reason and the thoughs has not changes. I want to portraying the relavans of the mother earth journal subjects to todays contemporary stages. 

On my transcoding I focused on two methods, preservation and transformation.

	* **WHAT:** I wanted to make it more possible to read and translate in web-based format, because the scans of the pages, is not straight and contrain a lot of dust from the microfilm machine.  

* **TOOL:** Photoshop, adobe reader

* **OUTCOME:** No dust files, more straight and translateable jpg files.
